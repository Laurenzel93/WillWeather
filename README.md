WillWeather is a simple weather forecast app, which uses some APIs to fetch 5 day / 12 hour forecast data from OpenWeather and to fetch cities/map from Mapbox. The main goal of this app is to assist users as a weather forecaster and day planner to plan out their daily outdoor activities.

A user should be able to search for their local city to then be provided a interactive map, the current date and temperature. A user will then be guided to the day planner featuring current times and temperatures to plan out their daily tasks and activities all utilizing one simple platform. Users can look ahead in the week with the 5-Day forecast. 

## Tools

We had fun with this project!
We faced challenges with our chosen APIs, and had to scour the web to find Front-End applicable APIs.
We conquered learning a new CSS framework.
We successfully collaborated on GitHub for the first time, with a little help.
